  "transcript": "[Music] hi welcome to another video so I recently covered small agents which were pretty good and simple to use but they couldn't control a browser and do stuff like a human would similar to claude's computer use but today I have one such AI agent that can control a whole web browser and do whatever you ask it to do this AI agent is called midene JS midene is an open-source JavaScript library and it is supposed to be an AI powered automation SDK that can control the page perform assertions and extract data in Json format using natural language if you remember browser use then it's quite similar to that it can do natural language interaction which means that all you need to give it is the task and let midene plan and control the user interface for you it can also understand UI and answer in Json so this is pretty handy as it allows you to give it a Json format that you want along with your prompt and it can navigate through a page extract that information and give back structured responses to you which is good so this is a really good thing as well it can also do intuitive assertion as well one of the good parts about it is that it also has a Chrome extension which means that you can easily plug that in and make it work easily that way it also has support for all types of llms as well now let me tell you how you can use it and how it all works but before we do that let me tell you about today's sponsor photogenius AI photogenius AI is an all-in-one AI powered art generator that allows you to type anything and get stunning visuals instantly photogenius AI gives you all kinds of image generation models in one place whether it be flux stable diffusion cardinski or any image generator model that you can think of not just that it also gives you the option to do Advanced AI image editing as well with their cool AI tools like an AI Avatar generator background removal logo generator Emoji generator or even add an app icon generator and the best part is that it starts at only $10 and you can get an additional 25% off these already great deals by using my coupon code king2 so make sure that you check out photog genius. through the Link in the description and generate some cool stuff with it now if we talk about how you can use it then there are two options you can either use it via a Chrome extension that they have or you can also use the yl file to use it and then run it and use it most of you would like to use the Chrome extension so I'll talk about that first and then I'll move to how you can also use it with yl files now to install the Chrome extension just go to the Google Chrome extension Marketplace and search for midene JS and get it installed once done you'll see the mid scene thing in your browser now we'll need to get it configured as well I'll be using the Gemini 2.0 flash model because it's free and performs really well so to do that you'll need to First navigate to this model and provider page in here and then you can see all kinds of model settings that you can use here's the Gemini one so just copy this and paste it in by clicking this option and pasting it here now change the model name to Gemini 2.0x and then enter the API key once you have done that we can start using it now you can see that this is the interface and it's quite simple Le here you have the options of action query and assert the action option will take in what your prompt is and it will run actions like clicking and writing and stuff like that to perform just what you want apart from this you have query which is basically like action but it can also extract any kind of data you want from those actions as well so you can ask it to get the Nvidia stock price and it can give you the answer in textual format there's also assertion assertion from what I understand is mainly for testing so it can basically see the page and you can ask it to make sure that a button's color is red or that a button is working and it can do that and give you a pass element in true or false this is mainly for testing the uis and stuff that you make now let me show you how the action thing works so one thing that you need to keep in mind is that it can only work on the website that you already have open it can navigate through here but it can't directly open another page so it's better to start it with something like Google anyway let's ask it to search for AI code King and hit enter let's send it once we do that you can see that it starts working working on it let's wait a bit you can see that it first writes it into the search text box and if we wait a bit more then you can see that it hits the search button now it has done what we asked it to do and it has the stuff we wanted so that's great now let's also try something else which is to ask it for the Nvidia stock price once we send it you can see that it starts searching for it also when it does the stuff you'll see the mid scene debugging thing at the top as well anyway if we wait a bit then you can see that it's now done which is great and it worked fine as well now let's say that we want to scrape this and get a good Json structure out of it based on our prompt well then we can just go to the query thing and here you can ask it to give you the stock price once we type it in and send it you'll see that it analyzes the page and now we have the answer here in a structured format now this is just a basic thing if you have a longer or bigger page then you can easily just ask it to make it structured and it can do it very easily which is great and insane to think about let's try it with something else as well I have Google flights open here and I want it to search for flights between New York and Chicago on the 10th of January let's send it once we do it you can see that it starts doing that let's wait a bit and it's now done so it did this pretty well which is just amazing so it works pretty well and great so that's basically how it works but some of you may also want to use it in more complex settings as well well in that case you can use the yl configuration so you can make yl files like this or you can enter the target URL task and everything quite simply which is similar to the settings that you encounter in the extension then you can install the midene npx package export the same API Keys as you did for the extension and just run the wh ml file like this with the midene SE tool once you do that it will open up Chrome in debugging mode and start using it it's really good as well so that's basically how it works I think that this is pretty great to use and it's a great AI agent similar to browser use and it works pretty well with all kinds of llms that you want to use it's also great for end consumers who just want to use it quite easily with something like the Chrome extension so that's great I think that this works well and could be used easily in UI testing as well as for doing repetitive tasks and it is surely on par with claude's computer use overall it's pretty cool anyway share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel you can also donate via super thanks option or join the channel as well
